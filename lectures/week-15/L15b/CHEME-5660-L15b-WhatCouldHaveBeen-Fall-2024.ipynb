    "## Topics that I wished we could have discussed more\n",
    "* There are __many ... many__ more models to predict share price (or return) than the lattice models, or [geometric Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion). These would have been interesting to talk about. Even simple extensions, such as GBM with jumps, would be interesting.\n",
    "* There are a bunch of interesting portfolio problems. For example, we never developed a robust reallocation approach to maintain some sense of optimality. We could have considered allocation strategies that bounded the expected return, not the risk. \n",
    "* I wish we could have simulated the operation, profit, and loss of portfolios that consist only of option contracts. Or perhaps the operation of a fund that does multiple simultaneous instances of [the wheel strategy](https://optionalpha.com/blog/wheel-strategy). How does the performance of this option-based approach compare with a passive approach such as buying and holding `SPY`?\n",

    "## What was the Practicum problem?\n",
    "A former student proposed a clever alternative to traditional portfolio allocation. The key component of the idea is to reframe portfolio allocation in the context of a constrained utility maximization problem, i.e., find the combination of asset weights that maximize the satisfaction of an agent subject to a budget constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "Suppose you have a collection of risky assets in portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$. The utility of any given configuration of $n_{i}$ shares (where $n_{i}$ denotes share count for asset $i\\in\\mathcal{P}$) can be scored using a utility function $U:\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{P}|} \\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, where $|\\mathcal{P}|$ is the number of assets in $\\mathcal{P}$. There are many possible utility functions, but one that is interesting is the Cobb-Douglas utility:\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "U(\\mathbf{n}) \\sim \\prod_{i\\in\\mathcal{P}}n_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients can incorporate information about current market conditions, news, the sentiment about asset $i$, or other information about asset $i$. Let's put all that data into a feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$. One could then imagine building a model for $\\gamma_{i}$ that is something like:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\gamma_{i} = \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{i}+\\mathbf{w}_{i}^{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is an activation function, $\\alpha_{i}$ is a bias term for asset $i$, and $\\mathbf{w}_{i}$ denotes the weights for the features of asset $i$. Putting all this together gives an alternative portfolio allocation problem for the share vector $\\mathbf{n}$:\n",

    "\\text{maximize}~U(\\mathbf{n}) &\\sim&  \\prod_{i\\mathcal{P}}n_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}} \\\\\n",
